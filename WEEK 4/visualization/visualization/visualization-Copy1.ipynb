    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite having only one lecture in this class fully devoted to the topic (though of course, virtually every other lecture will try as much as possible to integrate visualization whenever possible), visualization is a cornerstone of data science.  Although data managment, graph methods, map-reduce, machine learning, etc, often show up as the \"skills\" needed in data science positions, the reality is that learning how to visualize the data _before_ applying more sophisticated method, remains one of the hallmarks of an effective data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing visualization in detail, though, it is important to emphasize a distinction between two _very_ different concepts that people both describing using the umbrella term \"visualization\".  The first of these is \"visualization for data exploration\": using visualization to understand (that is, to undrstand yourself) a collection of data for the purposes of further analysis.  In a short phrase, this type of visualization has the goal of you \"finding what is true\" within the data.  The alternative is \"visualization for presentation\": distilling some aspect of the data into an easily-understandable figure or chart that conveys to a broad audience some very particular aspect of the data that you want to convey.  To again put it shortly, this type of visualization is about \"convincing other people your finding is true\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This class will focus almost entirely on the first type of visualization: using visual presentation to understand the data for your own purposes, for the sake of futher analysis and/or eventually creating a \"presentation-based\" visualization at a later point.  While there is certainly overlap between the two types of visualization (techniques that made it difficult for a broad audience to understand some fact about the data can just as easily cause you to miss the point when exploring the data), but data visualization as presentation does afford us some degree of looseness with it comes to the more stylistic aspects of data science.  We are, generally speaking, ok with \"ugly\" plots (as long as the ugliness doesn't prevent us from seeing the relevant features of the data), or or \"busy\" figures (as long as we are willing to invest the time to understand each element).  These aspects of course would not go over well when it comes to data presentation.  We may try to touch briefly on data visualization and presentation in a later lecture, but for the time being, these notes will focus on the exploratory aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A note on visualization and machine learning**:  It also hopefully goes without saying that visualization itself is merely one tool for data exploration, and that most of the analysis methods we cover in this course, including virtually all the machine learning approachs, can also serve as approaches to data exploration.  But (and this is a point we'll repeat extensively when we discuss machine learning in the course), a good rule of thumb in most machine learning algorithm is that _if you can't see the pattern you're trying to predict, neither will a machine learning algorithm_.  This is an important point to emphasize especially in light of the rise in (narrowly-defined of course) \"superhuman\" AI or ML algorithms that often comes up in popular press discussion of these fields: examples like Atari game playing or AlphaGo are frequently cited as cases where an AI system can outperform humans.  The unstated implication, then, is that in data science regimes we just need to give an algorithm access to all the data (much more than a human could ever process), and it will generate superhuman insights.  But this typically _not_ illustrative of the actual scenarios you will encounter in data science.  Yes, there exist cases where ML algorithms can outperform humans, but these are few and far between, and typically require many years of work to reach that point.  Instead, the goal of ML algorithms should be thought of as automating some tasks that humans are already quite capable of: that is, can they identify patterns that we can already see in the data, but do so in a more automatic and scalable manner?  And usually the only way to test what we _can_ see in the data is to visualize it.  That means that the best possible indication we have of whether or not a machine learning algorithm will \"work\" for a some given data problem is to visualize the data ourselves, and see if we can solve the problem.  This point will come up repeatedly in this course, but because visualization is so central to evaluating this claim, it is worth highlighting here."

    "Another point is worth making about visualizing data versus simply reporting statistics (with a small 's', as in, reporting the mean, variance, and other statistics about the data).  It is hopefully apparent, but still worth stating explicitly, that a visualization is virtually always going to provide more information that a small collection of numbers like this.  The following two distribution of points (one in blue and one in orange) have the same means standard deviations, and correlation.  "

In fact, in this case, it's trivial to perform an _exact_ transformation that guarantees two datasets will have these same parameters, which is exactly what we did in the figure above (the code is there, but don't worry if it's not too understandable, we are just applying a linear transform to make the second distribution match the mean and covariance of the first exactly).\n",

    "## Types of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Although becoming an expert in visualization techniques is well beyond the scope of this one set of notes on the topic, there are some basic rules of thumb about data, and what types of visualizations are appropriate for these different types of data, that can help avoid some of the more \"obviously incorrect\" errors you may make when generating visualizations for data exploration purposes.  To get at this point, we're going to review that four \"basic types\" of data typically presented in Statistics courses.  There are some common sticking points to this (such as the difference between the \"interval\" and \"ratio\" types of data, that often confuse people the first time they see these categories, and which in my opinion is not _that_ crucial of a distinction in many practical data science problem, mainly because true interval-and-not-ratio data is relatively rare), but it is a useful exercise to both know these terms and to begin to think about the implications that they have regarding visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "These categorization, which are more frequently called \"levels of measurement\" or \"scales of measurement\" (simply refering to them as types of data I believe is more understandable, if a bit imprecise, as long as it is not confused the \"data types\" in the programming language sense of the word), were developed in the psychology literature [(Stevens, 1946)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1671815?origin=JSTOR-pdf&seq=1), and there is a great deal of debate as to whether the categorizations are applicable broadly.  My goal here is not to argue for these categorizations from a philosophical standpoint, or argue that there are not important sub-categories or ambiguities within these definitions.  Nor do we make any case for this being some fundamentally rigorous classification system.  Rather, the only point here is to broadly introduce these categories as a useful, if imperfect, way of looking at different types of data, since they have been adopted as common classifications you're likely to encounter in discussions of this point.  The purpose of putting them here in this lecture on visualization is to highlight he crucial connection between the types of data you will encounter and the appropriate ways to illustrate and explore this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four basic types of data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nominal data:** categorical data with no inherent ordering between the categories.  For example, a \"pet type\" variable could consist of the classes {dog, cat, rabbit}, and there is no relative ordering between these two types, they are just different discrete values.\n",
    "- **Ordinal data:** categorical data _with_ an inherent ordering, but where the \"differences\" between categories has no strictly numerical meaning.  The canonical example here are survey responses with responses such as: {strong disagree, slightly disagree, neutral, slightly agree, strongly agree}.  The important character here is that although there is a clear ordering between these types, there is no sense in which the difference between slightly agree and strongly agree is the \"same\" as the difference between neutral and slightly agree.\n",
    "- **Interval data:** numeric data, that is, data that can be mapped to a \"number line\"; the important aspect in contrast with ordinal data, though, is not the \"discrete versus continuous differentiation (integer values can be considered interval data, for instance), but the fact that relative differences in interval data _have_ meaning.  A classical example is temperature (in Fahrenheit or Celsius, a point which we will emphasize more shortly): here the differences between temperatures have a meaning: 10 and 15 degrees are separated by the same amount as 15 and 20 (this property is so inherent to numerical data that it almost seems strange to emphasize it).  On the other hand, interval data encompasses instances where the zero point has \"no real meaning\"; what this means in practice is that the _ratio_ between two data points has no meaning.  Twenty degrees Farenheit is not \"twice as hot\" in any meaningful sense than 10 degrees; and certainly not infinitely hotter than zero degrees.\n",
    "- **Ratio data:** also numeric data, but where the ratio between measurements _does_ have some meaning.  The classical example here is temperature Kelvin.  Obviously just like temperature Fahrenheit or Celsius, this is describing the basic phenomenon of temperature, but unlike the previous cases, zero Kelvin has a meaning in terms of molecular energy in a substance (i.e., that there is none).  This means that ratios have a real meaning: a substance at 20 degrees Kelvin has twice as much kinetic energy at the molecular level as that substance as 10 degrees Kelvin.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a course level, the first two data types can simply be viewed as \"categorial\" data (data taking on discrete values), whereas the later are \"numerical\" (taking real-valued numbers, though with the caveat that some level of discretization is acceptable even in numeric data, as long as the notion of differences are properly preserved.  Indeed, must of the later discussion on visualization will fall exactly along the categorial/real differentiation, though we will highlight some of the considerations when taking in account nominal vs. categorial and interval vs. ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be viewed in terms of the \"allowable operations\" we can perform on two data point of the different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nominal data:** $=, \\neq$.  All we can do with nominal data is compare two data points and test if they are equal or not.\n",
    "- **Ordinal data:** $=, \\neq, <, >$. In addition to checking for equality, we can also compare the ordering of different data points.\n",
    "- **Interval data:** $=, \\neq, <, >, -$. We have all the operations of ordinal data, but can also compute exact numeric differences between two data points.  Depending on context we may say that addition is allowed too, but sometimes addition actually assumes a zero point and so would only apply to ratio data.\n",
    "- **Ratio data:** $=, \\neq, <, 0, -, +, \\div$.  We have all the operations of interval data, but addition is now virtually always allowed, and we can additional perform division (to determine ratios) between different data points.\n",

Even this is often done incorrectly, and getting a basic understanding of the different types and data and relevant charts alone is a good first step in creating visualizations that help you (and eventually others), understand the data.\n",

The danger here is that when we view line plots, we inherently ascribe meaning to the _slope_ of the lines.  The problem is that because the \"distance\" between the different values in ordinal data explicitly has no meaning (remember, this is what differentiated ordinal from interval data); thus, the slope of these lines in the above figure has no meaning, and distracts from the actual data, which is just counts of the various categories.
